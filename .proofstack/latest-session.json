{"id":"session-1770836931002","createdAt":"2026-02-11T19:08:51.002Z","question":"Analyze this incident and recommend remediation steps.","draftAnswer":"The incident on 2026-02-08 involved a credential stuffing attack targeting the Customer Portal API's `/auth/login` endpoint, characterized by 4,812 failed login attempts from 36 distinct IPs, primarily within three suspicious IP ranges. The attack caused elevated latency (p95 latency rose from 220ms to 680ms) but no customer-facing outages or evidence of data exfiltration. Containment was achieved by applying rate limiting (25 requests/minute per IP), enforcing step-up MFA challenges on suspicious sessions, and blocking 12 abusive IPs, consistent with the organization's security policy.\n\nRemediation should focus on strengthening defenses against automated abuse by implementing bot detection mechanisms using user-agent and behavioral signals, as planned. Additionally, enforcing MFA for all admin accounts and auditing current MFA coverage aligns with policy requirements and reduces risk from compromised credentials. Enhancing alerting to detect \"success-after-fail\" login bursts will improve early detection of credential stuffing attempts. Finally, reviewing and updating password policies to meet or exceed current standards will help mitigate credential reuse risks.","verifiedAnswer":"Verified Answer\n\nEvidence-supported points:\n- The incident on 2026-02-08 involved a credential stuffing attack targeting the Customer Portal API's /auth/login endpoint. [E1] [E2] [E3]\n- There were 4,812 failed login attempts during the attack. [E4]\n- The failed login attempts originated from 36 distinct IPs. [E5]\n- The IPs were primarily within three suspicious IP ranges. [E6] [E7]\n- The attack caused p95 latency to rise from 220ms to 680ms. [E8]\n- There were no customer-facing outages or evidence of data exfiltration during the attack. [E9] [E10] [E11]\n- Containment was achieved by applying rate limiting of 25 requests per minute per IP. [E12]\n- Step-up MFA challenges were enforced on suspicious sessions during containment. [E13] [E14]\n- 12 abusive IPs were blocked consistent with the organization's security policy.
