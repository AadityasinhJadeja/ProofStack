{"id":"session-1770836261473","createdAt":"2026-02-11T18:57:41.473Z","question":"Analyze this incident and recommend remediation steps.","draftAnswer":"The incident on 2026-02-08 involved a credential stuffing attack targeting the Customer Portal API's `/auth/login` endpoint, with 4,812 failed login attempts from 36 distinct IPs, primarily within three suspicious IP ranges. The attack caused elevated latency (p95 latency rose from 220ms to 680ms) but no service outages or evidence of data exfiltration. Containment was achieved by applying rate limiting (25 requests/minute per IP), enforcing step-up MFA for suspicious sessions, and blocking 12 abusive IPs, which reduced failed login rates to baseline within 20 minutes.\n\nRemediation should focus on strengthening authentication defenses per the existing security policy. This includes enforcing MFA for all customer accounts (currently only recommended), auditing and ensuring MFA coverage for all admin accounts, and enhancing bot detection using user-agent and behavioral signals to identify automated attacks earlier. Additionally, implementing alerting on “success-after-fail burst” patterns can help detect compromised credentials used after failed attempts. Reviewing and updating password policies to align with current best practices will further reduce credential stuffing risks.\n\nContinuous monitoring and log retention for at least 90 days, as mandated, should be maintained to support forensic analysis. Finally, the incident response process was effective but can be improved by automating rate limiting and MFA triggers to reduce response time and by expanding blocking criteria to include IP reputation and behavioral anomalies beyond failure rates.","verifiedAnswer":"Verified Answer\n\nEvidence-supported points:\n- The incident on 2026-02-08 involved a credential stuffing attack targeting the Customer Portal API's /auth/login endpoint.
