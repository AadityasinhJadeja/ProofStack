{"id":"session-1770835796757","createdAt":"2026-02-11T18:49:56.757Z","question":"Analyze this incident and recommend remediation steps.","draftAnswer":"The incident on 2026-02-08 involved a credential stuffing attack targeting the Customer Portal API's `/auth/login` endpoint, characterized by a spike of 4,812 failed login attempts from 36 distinct IPs, primarily within three suspicious IP ranges. The attack caused elevated latency (p95 latency rose from 220ms to 680ms) but no customer-facing outages or evidence of data exfiltration. Containment was achieved by applying rate limiting (25 requests/minute per IP), enforcing step-up MFA for suspicious sessions, and blocking 12 abusive IPs, consistent with the organization's security policy.\n\nRemediation should focus on strengthening defenses against automated abuse by implementing bot detection signals such as user-agent and behavioral analysis, as planned. Enforcing MFA for all admin accounts and auditing current coverage aligns with policy requirements and reduces risk from credential reuse. Additionally, enhancing alerting to detect \"success-after-fail\" login bursts can help identify compromised accounts early. Reviewing and updating password policies to ensure compliance with current standards will further mitigate credential stuffing risks. Maintaining thorough logging and monitoring will support rapid detection and response in future incidents.","domain":"Cyber/Security","strictness":"Balanced","useDemoDataset":true,"sources":[{"id":"source-incident-report","fileName":"demo1/incident_report.md","content":"# Incident Report: API Gateway Credential-Stuffing Attempt\n\n## Executive Summary\nOn **2026-02-08**, we observed a spike in failed login attempts against the **Customer Portal API**.\nThe activity was consistent with **credential stuffing** and originated from a small set of IP ranges.\nWe enabled additional rate limits and forced MFA challenges for suspicious traffic.
