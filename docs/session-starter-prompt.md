# Session Starter Prompt (paste into Codex every time)

You are working on ProofStack (Cyber). The source of truth is /docs.
First read /docs/context-pack.md and /docs/DECISIONS.md.
Then read /docs/implementation-plan.md and continue from the “Next:” item in context-pack.
Do not change scope. Implement the next smallest step only.
When done, update context-pack status + add a decision log entry if needed.
